    "### Jane Street Puzzle: Beside the Point\n",
    "\n",
    "I solved this puzzle from Jane Street earned a spot on their leaderboard all the way back in November, but I procrastinated posting my solution in detail until now. This notebook explains my approach to solving the puzzle. I ran a simulation first to have a good idea of the solution, but since the solution required at least 10 decimal places, an analytical approach was needed to place on the leaderboard. Below, I've explained the problem first, explained my simulation code, and then finally my mathematical solution.\n",
